# playground

PlayFindr is a web application that provides customers with a friendly helpful interface to help parents and guardians find playgrounds in Ireland. As part of our 3rd year Group Project module we aimed to develop a web application that meets the criteria listed in the above brief. Our playground finder service allows the user to search for playgrounds in a specific county, get directions to a playground from where they are currently located, view, add or edit playgrounds stored in the database, view a 5-day weather forecast for the location and add reviews of playgrounds. 

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.
